Version 1.0.1
This is an application meant for the Google Cardboard aimed to take Geographical Information System data and represent it in an interactive three-dimensional model. 
With many applications in research, education, and game design, we hope that this application will provide the frame work for many future endeavors.
Future work may include streaming information, gamification, and/or integration with social media sites.
